/**
 * TODO: Return a list of objects. Each object should have the following structure:
 * {
      name: song name,
      previewUrl: song preview url link,
      uri: link to song on spotify,
      artists: array of artists attributed on the song, // array
   }
 * 
 * WHY: Spotify gives us a lot of information. This function retrieves relevant info about our recommendations and passes it to the front-end.
 * 
 * EXTRA CREDIT: Take a look at the full json data given for each recommended song. See any other information you'd like to display on your page? 
 * 
 * EXTRA CREDIT 2: Incorporate design elements into the way you programmatically create new fields in your webpage. Consider content, typography, color, image, composition, and other design ideas discussed in the guest lecture.
