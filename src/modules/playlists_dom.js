/**
 * Creates a list element for a given playlist object and appends it as a child to the <ul> tag element on the index.html page.
 * Incoming playlist objects look like the following:
 * {
    name: playlistName, 
    imageUrl: playlistUrl,
  }
 * HINT: Don't forget to use DOM methods (createElement, setAttribute, appendChild). 
 * You can set the text of an HTML element in JavaScript using .innerHTML
 * 
 * EXTRA CREDIT: Tie in any other information that you might find interesting in the playlist data spotify makes available. How does that data get displayed for users to see?
 * 
 * EXTRA CREDIT 2: Incorporate design elements into the way you programmatically create new fields in your webpage. Consider content, typography, color, image, composition, and other design ideas discussed in the guest lecture.
